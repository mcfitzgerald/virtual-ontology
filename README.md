# SQLOnt: Virtual Ontology for Direct SQL Generation

## Overview

SQLOnt is a prototype system that explores a novel approach to semantic data integration by creating a "virtual ontology" layer. Instead of materializing data into formal ontology formats (OWL/RDF) and triple stores, SQLOnt leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly translate natural language queries into SQL using ontological context.

## Core Concept

Traditional semantic data systems require:
1. Formal ontology definition (OWL/RDF)
2. Data transformation into triple/graph format
3. Specialized query languages (SPARQL)
4. Complex ETL pipelines

**SQLOnt's approach:**
- Maintain data in existing SQL databases
- Define lightweight ontology (TBox/RBox with descriptions)
- Map ontological concepts to database schema
- Use LLM with ontology+schema context to generate SQL directly

## Key Innovation

By providing an LLM with both ontological structure and database schema mappings, we can preserve the semantic reasoning benefits of ontologies while eliminating the overhead of intermediate representations. This creates a more practical path to AI-compatible data access.

### Components

1. **Ontology Declaration Layer**
   - TBox (Terminological Box): Class hierarchies and properties
   - RBox (Role Box): Relationship definitions and constraints
   - Natural language descriptions for context
   - Mappings to SQL schema elements

2. **Query Processing Pipeline**
   ```
   Natural Language Query
           �
   Concept Extraction
           �
   Context Selection (relevant ontology/schema fragments)
           �
   LLM SQL Generation
           �
   Query Execution (with limits for preview)
           �
   Result Caching / Full Execution
           �
   Python Analysis Tools (for complex operations)
   ```

3. **Learning Loop**
   - Semi-random SQL exploration of ontology/data space
   - Compilation of successful query patterns
   - Pattern compression and context enhancement
   - Gradual improvement of generation success rate

### Environment Requirements

Designed to operate in an LLM-powered development environment (like Claude Code) with:
- LLM access for query generation
- Planning and execution loop capabilities
- Conversation-driven refinement
- File read/write for caching
- Tool access for SQL execution and data source connections

## Implementation Strategy

### Context Optimization
- **Minimal Effective Context**: Balance between completeness and token efficiency
- **Dynamic Selection**: Choose relevant ontology fragments based on query intent
- **Pattern Library**: Cached successful query templates indexed by concepts

### Failure Management
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: System augments human capability, not replace it
- **Progressive Refinement**: Iterative query improvement through conversation
- **Acceptable Failure Rate**: Optimize for speed and practicality over perfection

### Performance Optimization
- **Result Caching**: Local file store (Parquet/CSV) for query results
- **Preview Mode**: Use SQL LIMIT for LLM reasoning and verification
- **Python Processing**: Heavy analytical operations on cached data

## Advantages

1. **No ETL Required**: Work directly with existing SQL databases
2. **Semantic Reasoning**: Preserve ontological inference capabilities
3. **Practical Integration**: Lower barrier to semantic data access
4. **Flexible Evolution**: Learn and improve query patterns over time
5. **Human-Centric**: Augments rather than replaces human expertise

## Challenges & Mitigations

| Challenge | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Text-to-SQL failures | Ontology context reduces ambiguity |
| Complex joins | Query templates from ontology patterns |
| Context limits | Dynamic context selection |
| Semantic correctness | Validation against ontological constraints |
| Performance | Caching and preview mechanisms |

## Evaluation Metrics

Beyond traditional text-to-SQL benchmarks, SQLOnt requires evaluation of:
- **Semantic Correctness**: Queries respect ontological constraints
- **Inference Completeness**: Transitive/inherited relationships captured
- **Practical Efficiency**: Time-to-insight vs traditional approaches
- **User Satisfaction**: Reduction in query development time

## Project Status

**Current Stage**: Prototype/Exploration

**Goals**:
- Validate virtual ontology concept
- Establish acceptable failure rates
- Develop pattern learning mechanisms
- Create practical tooling for real-world use

## Future Directions

- Integration with existing ontology standards (OWL/RDFS)
- Automated ontology extraction from database schemas
- Multi-database federation through virtual ontology layer
- Query optimization using ontological constraints
- Benchmark development for semantic SQL generation
