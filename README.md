# Virtual Ontology: Direct SQL Generation from Business Language

## Overview

This project explores a surprisingly effective approach to semantic data access: using a "virtual ontology" layer that enables natural language REPLs (like Claude Code) to directly translate business questions into SQL. By combining traditional ontology concepts with modern LLM capabilities, we can work with existing databases without the overhead of formal semantic systems.

## The Virtual Ontology Architecture

![Virtual Ontology Architecture](virtual_ontology_diagram.png)

## How It Works

The virtual ontology approach combines several simple but effective ideas:

1. **Keep data in place** - Work directly with existing SQL databases
2. **Define business concepts** - Lightweight ontology (TBox/RBox) maps concepts to schema
3. **Leverage agent capabilities** - Natural language REPLs handle the translation
4. **Learn from usage** - Capture successful patterns for reuse

## What We've Learned

Through testing with real manufacturing data, this approach has proven surprisingly effective:

### Complex Business Analysis Works Well
- Identified significant improvement opportunities through systematic analysis
- 86% query success rate on first attempt, 100% with refinement
- Handles temporal patterns, cascading failures, financial calculations

### Natural Language Translation
Questions like these translate effectively to SQL:
- "Which equipment is the bottleneck on each line?"
- "What's the financial impact of material jams?"
- "Show cascade failures from upstream equipment"
- "Find quality issues specific to morning shifts"

### Pattern Learning
- Intent capture with every query
- Successful pattern extraction and reuse
- Gradual improvement through usage

### Practical Performance
- Handles 36,000+ record datasets efficiently
- Supports complex aggregations and window functions
- Integrates well with visualization tools

## Example Implementation: Manufacturing Analytics

This repository includes a working implementation using Manufacturing Execution System (MES) data that demonstrates the approach:

### Types of Analysis Possible
1. **Capacity Analysis**: Compare best vs current performance
2. **Bottleneck Detection**: Identify constraining equipment
3. **Quality Investigation**: Find patterns in defect rates
4. **Downtime Impact**: Calculate financial cost of stoppages
5. **Cascade Analysis**: Trace upstream/downstream effects

### The 8-Question Framework
Our proven analytical approach that builds understanding progressively:
1. Hidden capacity (best vs current performance)
2. Bottleneck identification
3. Downtime financial impact
4. Changeover analysis
5. True product profitability
6. Cascade failure detection
7. Quality issue mapping
8. Predictive maintenance opportunities

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the SQL API
```bash
# Start the FastAPI server
./api.sh start

# Verify it's running
./api.sh status
```

### 2. Execute Intent-Driven Queries
```bash
# CRITICAL: Always use file-based JSON (inline JSON will fail)
echo '{"sql": "SELECT AVG(oee_score) FROM mes_data"}' > /tmp/query.json
./query-log.sh POST /query --intent "Average OEE across facility" -d @/tmp/query.json
```

### 3. Analyze with Python
```python
# Load query results for visualization
import json
with open('query_logs.json', 'r') as f:
    logs = json.load(f)
# Create multi-panel dashboards, correlations, trends
```

## System Components

### 1. Ontology Layer (`ontology/ontology_spec.yaml`)
Defines business concepts, relationships, and rules:
- **Classes**: Equipment, Products, Events, Downtime Reasons
- **Relationships**: upstream/downstream, belongs-to, produces
- **Business Rules**: OEE calculation, cascade patterns, quality impact

### 2. Schema Mapping (`ontology/database_schema.yaml`)
Maps ontological concepts to database structure:
- Column mappings with business names
- Data types and constraints
- Indexed fields for performance

### 3. Query Interface (`query-log.sh`)
Intent-aware query execution with pattern learning:
- Captures business intent (≤140 chars)
- Logs successful patterns
- Builds reusable query library

### 4. Visualization Pipeline
Python-based analysis and visualization:
- Multi-panel dashboards (3x3 grid best practice)
- Statistical summaries with visual context
- Temporal patterns and correlations

## Comparison with Traditional Approaches

| Traditional Semantic Systems | Virtual Ontology Approach |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Requires ETL to RDF/OWL | Works with existing SQL databases |
| SPARQL expertise needed | Natural language queries |
| Complex triple stores | Simple SQL execution |
| Static ontology definitions | Evolving pattern library |
| Slow iteration cycles | Rapid exploration |
| High implementation cost | Low barrier to entry |

## Technical Insights

### What Works Brilliantly
- **Window functions** for temporal analysis
- **Self-joins** for equipment correlations
- **Financial calculations** integrated with operations
- **Pattern recognition** from intent logging
- **Progressive complexity** building from simple to advanced

### Known Limitations & Workarounds
- **No CTEs in SQLite**: Use subqueries instead
- **No STDDEV function**: Calculate range or use percentiles
- **JSON escaping in shell**: Always use file references
- **Large result sets**: Stream to Python for processing

### Success Patterns
```sql
-- Time-based analysis
SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) as hour, AVG(metric)
FROM mes_data GROUP BY hour

-- Bottleneck detection
SELECT equipment_id, MIN(performance_score) as constraint
FROM mes_data GROUP BY line_id

-- Financial impact
SELECT SUM(units * (price - cost)) as lost_margin
FROM mes_data WHERE status = 'Stopped'
```

## Why This Works

The ontology layer allows thinking in business terms (OEE, changeovers, cascading failures) rather than database terms (joins, foreign keys). This reduces cognitive load when formulating questions and captures business expertise in a reusable form.

The combination of semantic concepts with agent-based natural language processing creates a practical middle ground between rigid SQL and complex semantic systems.

## Future Directions

### Near-term Enhancements
- Automated context selection based on query complexity
- Confidence scoring for generated SQL
- Multi-database federation through virtual ontology
- Real-time pattern learning and suggestion

### Long-term Vision
- Industry-specific ontology libraries
- Automated ontology extraction from schemas
- Natural language data exploration interfaces
- Federated queries across heterogeneous systems

## Observed Results

### Quantitative
- Query Success Rate: 86% first attempt, 100% with refinement
- Pattern Library: 30+ reusable query templates generated
- Performance: Sub-second query generation on 36K+ records

### Qualitative
- Faster time-to-insight compared to manual SQL writing
- More accessible to business users
- Knowledge capture in ontology structure
- Continuous improvement through pattern learning

## Conceptual Approach

This project explores an alternative data access pattern:

**Traditional**: Raw Data → ETL → Data Warehouse → Reports → Insights

**Virtual Ontology**: Raw Data → Semantic Layer → Natural Language → Insights

By working directly with existing databases and leveraging agent capabilities, we can provide semantic benefits without the traditional overhead.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Start the API**: `./api.sh start`
3. **Test connectivity**: `./query-log.sh --test`
4. **Explore the ontology**: Review `ontology/ontology_spec.yaml`
5. **Run your first query**: Follow the Quick Start examples
6. **Analyze patterns**: Use Python notebooks for visualization
