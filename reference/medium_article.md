## The Ontology Revelation

"We f*cking won because of ontologies." 

When I stumbled across this Alex Karp quote, it sent me down a rabbit hole that would fundamentally change how I approach data analytics. Here's the CEO of Palantir—a company worth tens of billions—attributing their success not to AI or big data, but to *ontologies*. 

So I did what any curious engineer would do: I tried to build one.

The traditional approach to ontologies in data science is, well, traditional. You need RDF (Resource Description Framework), OWL (Web Ontology Language), triple stores, SPARQL queries. It's a whole ecosystem that requires converting your data into a specialized format, learning new query languages, and maintaining parallel infrastructure.

I built it. It worked. The SPARQL queries were elegant, the graph traversals were powerful. But after weeks of effort, I had to ask myself: was this practical for everyday use? Could I really tell my VP of Operations they needed to learn SPARQL to get insights from their manufacturing data?

The conversion overhead alone was a killer. ETL pipelines to transform SQL data into RDF triples. New systems to maintain. New expertise required. It felt like I'd solved one problem by creating three new ones.

## The Universal Analytics Challenge

Let's be honest about something everyone talks about but few actually solve: the gap between having data and having insights.

Every company claims to be "data-driven." Most are really "dashboard-driven"—and there's a huge difference. The real challenge in analytics isn't technical, it's systemic. Getting meaningful insights requires navigating multiple layers:

- **Technical barriers**: SQL expertise, understanding data models, knowing which tables join to which
- **Business context**: Domain expertise, tribal knowledge about how things *actually* work, strategic priorities
- **Analytical synthesis**: Statistical methods, pattern recognition, understanding correlation vs causation

Sure, we have dashboards. Lots of them. But dashboards are just views into data—they still require human interpretation. And when you're dealing with complex problems (the only ones worth solving), you need to synthesize multiple analyses with deep business context.

Where do you encode the knowledge that when Line 2 shows a "UNP-MAT" error code, it's probably because the upstream filler is jamming? Or that Tuesday morning quality issues are likely related to the skeleton crew from the holiday weekend? Or that the theoretical max output is actually 94% of rated capacity because of the 1987 retrofit that no one documented?

This semantic gap—between what the data says and what it means—is where most analytics initiatives die.

## From Triple Stores to Virtual Ontologies

My first prototype still used the traditional approach, just with a modern twist. I had an LLM write SPARQL queries against a graph database, then analyze the results. And you know what? SPARQL really does have advantages. The expressiveness for relationships is superior. Graph traversal is natural. Complex hierarchical queries are elegant.

But I kept coming back to one uncomfortable fact: 99% of enterprise data lives in SQL databases. Snowflake, Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server—that's where the data is. That's where it's going to stay.

The text-to-SQL benchmarks weren't encouraging either. Even the best models struggle with complex queries. But then I had a thought: what if the problem wasn't the LLM's ability to write SQL, but the context we were giving it?

What if we could virtualize the ontology layer?

Instead of converting data into triples, what if we kept it in SQL but gave the LLM enough semantic context to reason about it ontologically? Let the LLM handle the semantic reasoning, then output SQL for the existing infrastructure.

Enter Claude Code.

## Claude Code as the Enabling Platform

Here's what made everything click: Claude Code isn't just another coding assistant. It's a natural language REPL with persistent context, tool orchestration, and session management that actually works.

The magic happens when you pair two things:
1. An ontology specification (formal description of your business entities and relationships)
2. A database schema (the actual structure of your SQL data)

When these are properly paired—using the same terminology, mapping business concepts to table structure—Claude Code becomes a semantic reasoning engine that outputs SQL.

"Context is king" isn't just a throwaway phrase here. The LLM needs to understand that `equipment_id` in your database maps to the `Equipment` class in your ontology, which has upstream/downstream relationships that manifest as cascade failures in the real world.

## Real-World Application: Manufacturing Analytics

Let me show you what this looks like in practice. I built a demonstration using synthetic manufacturing execution system (MES) data—the kind of data I work with daily. (The synthetic data generator is in the repo if you want to verify the patterns are realistic.)

Here's what a 30-minute session discovered:

- **Equipment bottlenecks**: Every single production line was constrained by the packer equipment
- **Hidden capacity**: Current OEE averaged 68%, but historical peaks hit 94%—that gap represents millions in potential revenue
- **Cascade patterns**: Material jams (UNP-MAT) were causing downstream starvation, costing significant margin
- **Quality correlations**: Scrap rates showed temporal patterns linked to shift changes

Now, I want to be clear: these are findings from synthetic data. Your actual results will vary. But the *types* of insights—the connections between equipment performance, quality metrics, and financial impact—these are the real patterns that matter in manufacturing.

The key differentiator? We're getting to the size of the prize, not just statistics. Not "Line 2 is at 72% OEE" but "Improving Line 2 to median performance would yield $2.3M annually."

## The Technical Implementation

Here's what makes it work. First, the ontology specification:

```yaml
# Ontology Specification (T-Box/R-Box formalization)
ontology:
  name: "Manufacturing Execution System"
  domain: "Production Operations"
  
classes:
  Equipment:
    description: "Physical assets on production line"
    attributes: 
      - efficiency
      - upstream_dependencies
      - maintenance_schedule
    
  DowntimeEvent:
    description: "Production stoppage with reason code"
    attributes:
      - reason_code
      - duration
      - cascade_impact

relationships:
  is_upstream_of:
    domain: Equipment
    range: Equipment
    properties: 
      - cascade_delay: "typical seconds before downstream impact"
      - impact_correlation: "probability of cascade"
      
business_rules:
  material_starvation:
    when: "upstream equipment fails"
    then: "downstream shows UNP-MAT code"
    delay: "30-300 seconds typically"
```

Then, the paired database schema:

```yaml
# Database Schema - Paired with Ontology
tables:
  mes_data:
    columns:
      equipment_id: 
        type: string
        ontology_class: Equipment
        description: "Maps to Equipment entity"
      downtime_reason:
        type: string
        ontology_class: DowntimeEvent.reason_code
        description: "Reason codes for stoppages"
      timestamp:
        type: datetime
        description: "Event time, 5-minute granularity"
```

The pairing is crucial. When the LLM sees a business question about "bottlenecks," it can trace through the ontology to understand that bottlenecks manifest as equipment with low performance scores that constrain downstream equipment, then generate SQL that captures this business logic.

## Building Your Own Virtual Ontology

The process is surprisingly straightforward:

**Step 1: Create your ontology specification**
Feed Claude Code your raw data and domain knowledge. Spend 30 minutes in conversation: "This is manufacturing data. We have production lines with equipment. When upstream equipment fails, downstream equipment starves for material." The LLM will help formalize this into a proper T-Box/R-Box structure.

**Step 2: Generate the paired database schema**
Point Claude Code at your actual database. It will create a schema definition that maps ontology concepts to table structures. This is where you ensure `equipment_id` in the database maps to the `Equipment` class in your ontology.

**Step 3: Load both as context**
In your Claude Code session, load both YAML files. This gives the LLM the semantic understanding to reason about your business domain while generating SQL for your actual data structure.

**Step 4: Start asking questions**
"What equipment is constraining production?" becomes a properly formed SQL query that understands equipment relationships, performance metrics, and business impact.

The query pattern learning is currently a separate process—I extract successful query patterns and create templates. This could easily be automated as part of the workflow. Each session naturally builds on previous insights through Claude Code's context management.

## Beyond Manufacturing: A New Paradigm

Virtual ontologies work anywhere you have SQL data and complex business logic:

- **Healthcare**: Patient pathways, treatment effectiveness, readmission patterns
- **Finance**: Risk propagation, portfolio correlations, regulatory compliance
- **Logistics**: Supply chain dependencies, bottleneck analysis, route optimization
- **Retail**: Customer journey analysis, inventory optimization, demand forecasting

The pattern is universal: formalized knowledge + existing data + LLM reasoning = accessible insights.

What excites me most is that this makes ontologies practical. We're not asking organizations to rebuild their data infrastructure. We're not requiring specialized expertise in semantic technologies. We're meeting enterprises where they are—with their SQL databases and their business questions.

## The Future of Semantic Data Access

This approach validates what Karp understood: ontologies are powerful. But it also shows there are multiple paths to that power. The T-Box/R-Box concepts remain as valid as ever—they're well-founded in decades of knowledge representation research. What's changed is how we implement them.

Virtual implementation through LLMs makes semantic technologies accessible. Instead of requiring specialized infrastructure, we can leverage the reasoning capabilities of modern language models. Instead of formal query languages, we can use natural language. Instead of rigid schemas, we can have evolving understanding.

Palantir showed that ontologies could be a competitive advantage. What I'm showing is that the advantage doesn't require enterprise software or enterprise prices. With tools like Claude Code, we can build "Palantir-Lite"—and sometimes, lite is exactly what you need.

The code is open source because this idea is bigger than any one implementation. As more people experiment with virtual ontologies, we'll discover new patterns, new optimizations, new applications. The goal isn't to replicate Palantir—it's to democratize the core insight that made them successful.

## Get Started Today

This isn't theoretical. I'm using this approach in my daily work, finding real opportunities in real manufacturing data. The path from question to insight has shrunk from weeks to minutes. More importantly, it's a path that anyone can follow.
