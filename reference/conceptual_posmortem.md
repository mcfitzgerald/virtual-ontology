Thoughts on Ontology-Driven Analytics: A New Paradigm

  This experiment revealed a fascinating approach to data analysis that's quite different from traditional methods. Here are my key observations:

  ðŸŽ¯ The Power of Semantic Abstraction

  The ontology layer is genius - it lets you think in business terms (OEE, changeovers, cascading failures) rather than database terms (joins, foreign keys). This
  dramatically reduces the cognitive load when formulating questions. You asked about "material starvation" and the system knew to look for UNP-MAT codes - that mapping is
  gold.

  ðŸ’¡ Key Success Patterns I Noticed

  1. Start with natural language, not SQL - Your instruction to create 30 business questions first was brilliant. It forced exploration of the problem space before diving
  into implementation.
  2. Rapid iteration through failure - The 86% success rate actually understates the value. The 14% failures taught us more about the system than the successes. Each
  failure revealed a boundary.
  3. Tool imperfections as teachers - The query-log.sh JSON escaping issue forced us to understand the tool chain deeply. Now we know why it fails, not just that it fails.

  ðŸš€ Tips for This Workflow

  1. Build a query library incrementally
  # After each successful query, save it
  echo "Q: Find bottlenecks" >> QUERY_LIBRARY.md
  echo '```sql' >> QUERY_LIBRARY.md
  cat /tmp/successful_query.json | jq -r .sql >> QUERY_LIBRARY.md
  echo '```' >> QUERY_LIBRARY.md
  2. Create semantic aliases for common patterns
  # In your ontology, define computed metrics
  bottleneck_score: "MIN(performance_score) GROUP BY line_id"
  cascade_correlation: "time_diff < 5 AND downstream = 'UNP-MAT'"
  3. Test boundary conditions early
    - Try a CTE immediately (fails fast)
    - Test date functions with your actual data's timeframe
    - Check what statistical functions exist
    - Verify JSON escaping quirks
  4. Layer your analysis
  Level 1: Basic metrics (counts, averages)
  Level 2: Correlations (joins, time windows)
  Level 3: Financial impact (multiply by costs)
  Level 4: Predictive patterns (degradation trends)

  ðŸ”® Future Potential

  1. Natural Language to SQL via LLM
  def query_mes(question: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
      # LLM translates question using ontology context
      sql = llm.translate(question, ontology_spec)
      return execute_query(sql)
  2. Automated insight discovery
    - Run correlation analysis across all metric pairs
    - Automatically identify anomalies
    - Generate daily "what changed" reports
  3. Ontology evolution
    - Track which concepts are most queried
    - Add new relationships as patterns emerge
    - Version control the ontology like code

  ðŸŽ¨ The Beauty of This Approach

  What's elegant is how the ontology becomes a living document of business understanding. It's not just metadata - it's encoded expertise. When you define that "material
  starvation is usually caused by upstream failures," you're capturing tribal knowledge in code.

  âš¡ Quick Wins for Your System

  1. Fix the JSON escaping in query-log.sh
  # In the script, change line 106 from:
  $curl_args
  # To:
  "$@"  # Properly preserve arguments
  2. Add a query builder helper
  #!/bin/bash
  # query-builder.sh
  SQL="$1"
  echo "{\"sql\": \"$SQL\"}" | jq . > /tmp/query.json
  ./query-log.sh POST /query --intent "$2" -d @/tmp/query.json
  3. Create view definitions in the ontology
  virtual_views:
    hourly_oee:
      sql: "SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) as hour, AVG(oee_score) FROM mes_data GROUP BY hour"
    bottlenecks:
      sql: "SELECT equipment_id, AVG(performance_score) as avg_perf FROM mes_data GROUP BY equipment_id ORDER BY avg_perf LIMIT 5"

  ðŸ¤” Philosophical Insight

  This approach inverts the traditional data warehouse model. Instead of:
  Raw Data â†’ ETL â†’ Data Warehouse â†’ Reports

  You have:
  Raw Data â†’ Semantic Layer â†’ Natural Language â†’ Insights

  The semantic layer becomes the single source of truth for what business concepts mean, making the entire system more maintainable and understandable.

  ðŸŽ¬ Final Thought

  The coolest part? You've built a system where a business user could potentially write: "Show me why Line 2 is outperforming the others" and get a meaningful answer.
  That's the dream of self-service analytics actually realized.

  The combination of:
  - Ontology (what things mean)
  - SQLite (simple but capable)
  - Natural language (how humans think)
  - Systematic exploration (30 queries)

  ...creates a powerful pattern for understanding complex systems. This could be applied to any domain with rich interconnected data - healthcare, logistics, finance, etc.

  The future is semantic!
