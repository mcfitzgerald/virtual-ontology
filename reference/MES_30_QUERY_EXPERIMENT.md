## Failure Analysis

### Overall Statistics
- **Total Queries Attempted**: ~35 (including retries)
- **Successful Queries**: 30
- **Failed Queries**: 5
- **Success Rate**: 86%
- **Retry Success Rate**: 100% (all failures had working alternatives)

### Failure Categories

#### 1. Missing SQL Functions (2 failures)
- **STDDEV()**: Not available in SQLite
- **Solution**: Use MIN/MAX range or other statistical approximations

#### 2. API Restrictions (1 failure)
- **CTEs (WITH clauses)**: Rejected as "not SELECT statements"
- **Solution**: Rewrite using subqueries or multiple queries

#### 3. Date Handling Issues (2 failures)
- **DATE("now")**: No results with historical data
- **Complex datetime arithmetic**: Syntax differences
- **Solution**: Use actual date ranges or SQLite-specific functions

#### 4. Tool Issues (multiple attempts)
- **query-log.sh JSON escaping**: Shell mangled inline JSON
- **Solution**: Use file reference with `-d @/tmp/file.json`

### Learning Curve
- **First 10 queries**: 3 failures (learning phase)
- **Second 10 queries**: 1 failure (applying lessons)
- **Final 10 queries**: 1 failure (pushing boundaries)
- **Conclusion**: Rapid adaptation to system quirks

## Technical Discoveries

### Capabilities Confirmed
✅ **Window Functions**: LAG, LEAD, OVER work perfectly
✅ **Complex Joins**: Self-joins for correlation analysis
✅ **Financial Calculations**: Full arithmetic operations
✅ **Date Extraction**: strftime() for time-based analysis
✅ **Conditional Logic**: CASE statements fully supported
✅ **Aggregation**: All standard functions except STDDEV
✅ **Performance**: Handles 36K records efficiently

### Limitations Identified
❌ **No CTEs**: Must use subqueries
❌ **No STDDEV**: Statistical functions limited
❌ **No NOW()**: Use datetime('now') but won't match historical data
❌ **JSON Escaping**: query-log.sh requires file input
❌ **SELECT Only**: No DDL or DML operations
❌ **1000 Row Default**: Must specify higher limits

### SQLite-Specific Syntax
```sql
-- Date functions that work
strftime('%H', timestamp)  -- Hour extraction
strftime('%w', timestamp)  -- Day of week
DATE(timestamp)            -- Date only
julianday(t1) - julianday(t2)  -- Date differences

-- Functions that don't work
STDDEV(column)            -- Not available
NOW()                     -- Use datetime('now')
INTERVAL '1 hour'         -- Use datetime modifiers
```

  AVG(metric) as hourly_avg
FROM mes_data
GROUP BY hour
```

### Pattern 2: Financial Calculations
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(units * price) as revenue,
  SUM(units * cost) as cost,
  SUM(units * (price - cost)) as profit
FROM mes_data
```

### Pattern 3: Equipment Correlation
```sql
SELECT a.equipment_id, b.equipment_id, COUNT(*)
FROM mes_data a
JOIN mes_data b ON [time proximity condition]
WHERE [correlation condition]
```

### Pattern 4: Distribution Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
  ROUND(metric/10)*10 as bucket,
  COUNT(*) as frequency
FROM mes_data
GROUP BY bucket
```

## Experiment Conclusions

## Appendix: Successful Query Techniques

### Handling Missing STDDEV
```sql
-- Instead of STDDEV(oee_score)
SELECT 
  AVG(oee_score) as mean,
  MAX(oee_score) - MIN(oee_score) as range,
  CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN oee_score > AVG(oee_score) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(*) as above_mean_pct
FROM mes_data
```

### Working Around CTE Restriction
```sql
-- Instead of WITH cte AS (...)
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT ... complex query ...
) AS subquery
WHERE conditions
```

### Date Filtering for Historical Data
```sql
-- Don't use: WHERE timestamp > datetime('now', '-7 days')
-- Use: WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2025-06-07' AND '2025-06-14'
```

### Proper JSON for query-log.sh
```bash
# Create file first
cat > /tmp/query.json << 'EOF'
{"sql": "SELECT * FROM mes_data LIMIT 10"}
EOF

# Then reference file
./query-log.sh POST /query --intent "Test query" -d @/tmp/query.json
```

## Final Score

| Metric | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Query Success Rate** | 86% | All failures had workarounds |

# Session 2: Manufacturing Improvement Analysis with Visualizations

## Session Overview
Date: 2025-08-03
Purpose: Deep-dive analysis to identify specific improvement opportunities
Approach: 8 strategic business questions with comprehensive visualization

## Key Process Learnings from Session 2

### 1. Query Patterns That Worked Well
- **File-based JSON** (`-d @/tmp/query.json`) was absolutely critical - inline JSON consistently failed
- **Building complexity gradually** - start with simple queries, then layer in complexity
- **Using business terminology** from ontology (e.g., "UNP-JAM" codes) made queries more intuitive

### 2. Analytical Framework Success
The **8 strategic questions approach** was highly effective:
1. Hidden capacity (best OEE vs current)
2. Bottleneck identification
3. Million-dollar downtime problems
4. Changeover impact
5. True product profitability
6. Cascade failure detection
7. Quality issue mapping
8. Predictive maintenance opportunities

This progression naturally builds understanding and context, with each answer informing the next question.

### 3. Visualization Integration
- **Combining SQL + Python** was powerful - SQL for aggregation, Python for visualization
- **Multi-panel dashboards** (3x3 grid) provided comprehensive view in one image
- **Statistical summary + visual** combination gave both detail and patterns

### 4. Critical Technical Patterns

#### Query Execution
```bash
# ALWAYS use file reference for JSON
echo '{"sql": "SELECT ..."}' > /tmp/query.json
./query-log.sh POST /query --intent "description" -d @/tmp/query.json

# NEVER use inline JSON (will fail)
./query-log.sh POST /query -d '{"sql": "SELECT ..."}' # FAILS!
```

#### Large Result Handling
```python
# When results are truncated, load from query_logs.json
with open('query_logs.json', 'r') as f:
    logs = json.load(f)
    
for entry in logs:
    if entry['id'] == 'query_id_here':
        data = json.loads(entry['response'])['data']
```

### 5. Business Impact Translation
- Convert operational metrics to financial impact immediately
- Annualize findings for executive impact (2 weeks → annual)
- Rank opportunities by $ value, not just operational metrics
- Connect patterns to root causes with clear hypotheses

### 6. User Interaction Patterns
- **Progressive disclosure** - Summary first, then details
- **Visual + numerical** combination for different audiences
- **Business questions** rather than technical queries
- **Clear action items** with quantified impact

## Discovered Business Insights (Session 2)

### Financial Impact Summary
- **Hidden Capacity**: $2.3M annual opportunity (25% OEE improvement possible)
- **Material Jams**: $21M annual loss (top downtime cause)
- **Premium Juice Quality**: $7.7M annual scrap loss
- **Total Opportunity**: $25M+ through operational excellence

### Critical Findings
1. **Packer equipment is the universal bottleneck** across all lines
2. **32oz Premium Juice has 18% scrap rate** vs 4-6% for other products
3. **Morning shift quality 6% worse** than afternoon (temperature/startup issues)
4. **Line 1 systematically underperforms** Lines 2 and 3
5. **Excessive changeovers** - Line 2 changes product every 19 minutes

### Root Cause Hypotheses (Premium Juice Crisis)
1. **Recipe/Formulation Issue** - Consistent 18% failure points to specification problem
2. **Temperature Sensitivity** - Morning quality problems suggest viscosity issues
3. **Line 1 Calibration** - Needs full equipment audit
4. **Crew Training Gap** - Morning shift needs Premium Juice training

## Visualization Best Practices

### Multi-Panel Dashboard Structure
```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(16, 12))
# 3x3 grid covering:
# 1. Equipment comparison
# 2. Time trends
# 3. Heatmaps
# 4. Distributions
# 5. Hourly patterns
# 6. Line comparisons
# 7. Correlations
# 8. Worst performers
# 9. Top issues
```

### Color Coding
- Red: Problem areas / below target
- Green: Target lines / good performance
- Orange/Yellow: Warning / attention needed
- Blue: Neutral comparisons

## Combined Sessions Conclusion
Both sessions demonstrate the power of:
- Semantic ontology layers for business translation
- Strategic question progression for discovery
- SQL aggregation + Python visualization for insights
- Financial impact quantification for prioritization

Total opportunities identified across sessions: **$65M+ annually**
