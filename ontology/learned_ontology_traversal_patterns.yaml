# USAGE GUIDELINES
# ====================================================================================

usage_guidelines:
  pattern_selection:
    - "Choose patterns based on the ontological concepts involved in your query"
    - "Start with simple patterns and combine them for complex queries"
    - "Consider the relationships and hierarchies defined in your ontology"
    
  pattern_combination:
    - "Patterns can be nested (e.g., use class filtering within temporal slicing)"
    - "Use subqueries to combine multiple patterns"
    - "Apply property aggregations after relationship traversals"
    
  optimization_tips:
    - "Index columns used in JOIN conditions and WHERE clauses"
    - "Use appropriate time windows for temporal patterns"
    - "Consider query complexity when combining multiple patterns"
    
  adaptation_guidelines:
    - "Replace placeholder variables ({table}, {field}) with actual names"
    - "Adjust thresholds and categories based on domain requirements"
    - "Modify aggregation functions based on data types and needs"
